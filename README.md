# monado-task-switcher

Switches between multiple active non-overlay sessions under Monado

will build for literally fucking everything as i only depend on libc, just get a zig compiler (i tested with `0.14.0-dev.3213+53216d2f2` but newer will *probably* also work) and go wild idk

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```
